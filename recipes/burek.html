        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An Eastern European delicacy. Probably one of the most loved foods from the Balkans. There are two ways to create burek: with homemade dough or with phyllo dough (pre-made store-bought). </p>
        <p>In this recipe we will be using the pre-made phyllo dough. You can put potatoes, meat, spinach, boiled cabbage, or feta cheese inside! This one will be with feta cheese. Truly a tasty meal! And very easy to make! Eat with yogurt for authenticity.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup feta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 package phyllo dough</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet lightly.</li>
            <li>Mix feta cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk milk and oil together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Brush milk-oil mixture over 3 sheets of phyllo dough and stack together. Place some of the cheese mixture in a straight line on one end of the dough. Roll up tightly to form a spiral shape. Transfer spiral to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining milk-oil mixture, phyllo dough, and cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.</li>
